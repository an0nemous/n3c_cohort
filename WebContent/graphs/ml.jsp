			 				<p class="table-description"> To demonstrate the utility of the N3C cohort for analytics, several machine learning (ML) 
								models were developed that accurately predict a severe clinical course. All models were developed using data 
								associated with the first calendar day of a patient's hospital encounter, aggregated from 34 medical centers 
								nationwide. To ensure that outcomes would be represented in the data, only patients with at least one 
								hospital overnight were included, all laboratory-confirmed positive (n &asymp; 32,000). Randomly selected 
								training (70%) and testing (30%) sets were stratified by outcome proportions, and potential predictors were present 
								for at least 15% of the training set. Input variables are the most abnormal value on the first calendar day of 
								the hospital encounter. When patients did not have a laboratory test value on the first calendar day, normal values 
								for specialized labs (e.g. ferritin, procalcitonin) and the median cohort value for common labs 
								(e.g. sodium, albumin) were imputed.</p>
